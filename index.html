          <h3>Innovative Student Mobility Solution: Introducing Rented Electric Bikes
          </h3>
          
        </li>
        <P>

            Introduction:
            Recognizing the transportation challenges faced by students outside college premises, we have developed an innovative project aimed at enhancing mobility and convenience. Our initiative, aptly named Rented Electric Bikes, addresses the need for accessible and eco-friendly transportation options for students.<br><br>
            
            Objective:
            Our primary objective is to provide students with a convenient mode of transportation for their off-campus needs, such as commuting to nearby locations or running errands. By offering electric bikes through a user-friendly booking platform, we aim to promote sustainable mobility while ensuring ease of access and affordability.<br><br>
            
            Key Features:
            1. Non-Registered Electric Vehicles: Our fleet consists of non-registered electric bikes, eliminating the need for students to navigate through bureaucratic processes or face police stops during their commute.
            2. Online Booking Portal: Students can conveniently access our services through our website, where they can easily book a bike for their desired duration.
            3. Flexible Payment Model: We employ a flexible payment system based on vehicle usage, allowing students to pay according to the distance traveled or the time spent with the bike.
            4. Secure Identification Process: To ensure security and accountability, we collect student ID proofs before providing access to our electric bikes.
            5. Fully Charged Vehicles: Each bike is meticulously maintained and fully charged, ready to facilitate hassle-free rides for students.<br><br>
            
            Benefits:
            1. Enhanced Mobility: Our project enables students to explore their surroundings beyond the college campus, fostering independence and exploration.
            2. Environmental Sustainability: By promoting the use of electric vehicles, we contribute to reducing carbon emissions and mitigating environmental impact.
            3. Cost-Effective Solution: Rented Electric Bikes offer a cost-effective alternative to traditional transportation methods, allowing students to save on expenses associated with owning a personal vehicle or relying on public transport.
            4. Convenience and Accessibility: With our user-friendly booking platform and hassle-free service, students can access transportation whenever and wherever they need it, without the constraints of traditional bike ownership.<br><br>
            
            Conclusion:
            Rented Electric Bikes represent a pioneering solution to the transportation needs of students, blending innovation, sustainability, and convenience. By empowering students with accessible and eco-friendly mobility options, we aspire to enrich their college experience and contribute positively to their daily lives.</p>

            <h3> Google Cloud Internship</h3>
            <img src="Screenshot (82).png" alt="certificate"  width="300" height="300" class="center-image">
            <p>Embarking on the Google Cloud internship was an exhilarating journey that transformed my perspective on cloud computing 
              and its vast applications. Throughout the internship, I had the privilege of collaborating with brilliant minds and seasoned 
              professionals, each interaction contributing to my growth as a technologist. The journey was not without its hurdles, yet each 
              obstacle presented an opportunity for learning and refinement. As I reflect on my time at Google Cloud, I am filled with 
              gratitude for the invaluable lessons learned, the friendships forged, and the doors opened to new possibilities in the 
              ever-evolving landscape of cloud computing.</p>
